I will post my weekly Python Code here about 4 times a week. Every Tuesday you can find a Blog on 'Discussions'. 
Schedule: My Schedule is really spontaneus. Every Tuesday I am starting with a new Day in Advent of Code. Depending on how far i've come I continue programming on that task in the following days. If I claimed the star of the day I do some smaller programs just to improve my understanding of some functions in python.
